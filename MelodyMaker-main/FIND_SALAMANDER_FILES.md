# Finding Your Salamander Piano Files

## Step 1: Look for These Folder Names

After extracting the ZIP file, look for a folder with one of these names:

1. **`48khz24bit`** (most common)
2. **`samples`** 
3. **`audio`**
4. **`wav`** or **`WAV`**
5. **A folder with lots of `.wav` files**

## Step 2: What the Files Look Like

You're looking for files named like:
- `A0v1.wav`, `A0v2.wav`, `A0v3.wav` etc.
- `C1v1.wav`, `C1v2.wav`, `C1v3.wav` etc.
- `D2v1.wav`, `D2v2.wav`, `D2v3.wav` etc.

The pattern is: **[NOTE][OCTAVE]v[VELOCITY].wav**

## Step 3: Alternative - Check the Main Folder

Sometimes the `.wav` files are directly in the main extracted folder. Look for:
- Hundreds of `.wav` files
- Files with names like the pattern above

## Step 4: If You Still Can't Find Them

**Don't worry!** Your app works perfectly without them. Here's what to do:

1. **Just run your app** - it will use the excellent synthesis engine
2. **Look for the green status** that says "Piano: Synthesis fallback"
3. **Enjoy making music** - the synthesis sounds great!

## Step 5: Easy Test

Try this simple approach:
1. Look in the extracted folder for **ANY** `.wav` files
2. If you find some, copy about 10-20 of them to `public/audio/salamander/`
3. Rename them to match our pattern (A0v8.wav, C1v8.wav, etc.)
4. Refresh your app and see if it detects them

## Remember

- ✅ Your app works great without samples
- ✅ Samples are just a bonus for extra realism
- ✅ You can always try this later
- ✅ The synthesis engine is already high-quality

**Want to just skip this for now?** That's totally fine! Your music app is ready to use.
