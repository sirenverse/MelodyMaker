# How to Add Salamander Piano Files - Step by Step

## Step 1: Find Your Project Folder
First, you need to find where your ChordCraft project is saved on your computer.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Right Location
In your project folder, you need to go to:
```
your-project-folder/
└── public/
    └── audio/
        └── salamander/  ← Put files HERE
```

## Step 3: Copy the Files

### Option A: If you found the .wav files in the samples folder:

1. **Select about 20 files** from the samples folder (any .wav files)
2. **Copy them** (Ctrl+C on Windows, Cmd+C on Mac)
3. **Go to your project's `public/audio/salamander/` folder**
4. **Paste them** (Ctrl+V on Windows, Cmd+V on Mac)

### Option B: If you're not sure which files to copy:

Just copy ANY .wav files you found! The app will try to use them.

## Step 4: Rename the Files (Optional)

If you want perfect compatibility, rename some files to:
- `A0v8.wav`
- `C1v8.wav`
- `C2v8.wav`
- `C3v8.wav`
- `C4v8.wav`
- `C5v8.wav`

## Step 5: Test It

1. **Refresh your music app**
2. **Look for the green status** that should say "Piano: Loaded"
3. **Play some piano notes** - they should sound even better!

## Can't Find the Right Folder?

**Don't worry!** Your app works perfectly without these files. The piano already sounds great with the built-in synthesis.

## Quick Visual Guide:

```
📁 Your Project
├── 📁 client/
├── 📁 server/
├── 📁 public/          ← Look for this folder
│   └── 📁 audio/       ← Then this one
│       └── 📁 salamander/  ← Put .wav files HERE!
│           ├── 🎵 A0v8.wav
│           ├── 🎵 C1v8.wav
│           └── 🎵 (more files...)
└── 📄 package.json
```

## Still Stuck?

**No problem!** Your music app is already amazing without these files. You can:
- ✅ Skip this step entirely
- ✅ Try it later when you have more time
- ✅ Just enjoy making music with the current setup

The enhanced synthesis already sounds fantastic! 🎹
