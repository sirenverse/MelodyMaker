# How to Add Salamander Piano Samples

## Method 1: Direct Download (Easiest)

1. **Go to this link**: https://github.com/sfzinstruments/SalamanderGrandPiano/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

2. **Download the ZIP file** - it will download automatically

3. **Extract the ZIP file** on your computer

4. **Find the samples**: Look for the folder `48khz24bit` inside the extracted folder

5. **Copy these specific files** to your project's `public/audio/salamander/` folder:
   - A0v8.wav
   - C1v8.wav  
   - E1v8.wav
   - A1v8.wav
   - C2v8.wav
   - E2v8.wav
   - A2v8.wav
   - C3v8.wav
   - E3v8.wav
   - A3v8.wav
   - C4v8.wav
   - E4v8.wav
   - A4v8.wav
   - C5v8.wav
   - E5v8.wav
   - A5v8.wav
   - C6v8.wav
   - E6v8.wav
   - A6v8.wav
   - C7v8.wav

## Method 2: If you can't find the files

Don't worry! The app will work perfectly with just the enhanced synthesis engine. The samples are just a bonus for even better piano sound.

## What happens if you don't add the samples?

- ✅ Your app will work perfectly
- ✅ Piano will use advanced synthesis (still sounds great!)
- ✅ All other features work normally
- ✅ You can add samples later anytime

## File Structure Should Look Like:

```
your-project/
├── public/
│   └── audio/
│       └── salamander/
│           ├── A0v8.wav
│           ├── C1v8.wav
│           ├── E1v8.wav
│           └── ... (other files)
├── client/
├── server/
└── ...
```

## Testing

After adding files, refresh your app and look for:
- Green status showing "Piano: Loaded" 
- Better piano sound quality
- Fallback to synthesis if samples don't load
